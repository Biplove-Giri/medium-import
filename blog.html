                   In this Article, we will carry out the implementation on resizing the EBS volume from 8GB to 10 GB. 
                  Here is the step by step process with proper screenshots

                  Move the data stored in one volume from one EC2 instance to another EC2 instance assuming the previous EC2 instance has been corrupted.
                    Before you may attach an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume to another instance or remove it, you must first detach it from the current one. The data on a volume is unaffected by its detachment.
                    Unmount and detach a volume
                    Detach the volume from the instance
